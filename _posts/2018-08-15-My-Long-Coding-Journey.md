I remember when I realised I wasn’t going to have a straightforward career. I had just given a day-long Art Psychotherapy workshop to a large group of Kazakh social workers. It had been an invigorating and exciting opportunity, but at the end of the day I saw with full clarity limits of my career prospects.

Kazakhstan was my first posting as a diplomatic spouse. Although I was enjoying the adventure of fresh discoveries, I felt completely clueless about my role. What was I doing here? It was difficult not to feel like an appendage as I struggled to fit my value into an equation that was not of my own making. About four months into the posting, I had tried to find ways to remain engaged my field, but felt I was failing. With my visa status restricting my ability to work without sponsorship, the best I could find were volunteering opportunities with a wonderful Art Therapy charity. Whilst rewarding, with US student loan debt hanging over my head and a lack of ability to practice in a clinical environment, my practical side was screaming for me to meet higher career ambitions.

Fortunately an opportunity presented itself and I began my first reinvention as Communications Manager at an Embassy. I jumped on the opportunity, even though my career background was completely different. I had to learn quickly and there were lots of moments of self-doubt but relished being challenged and I could see new career horizons in front of me.

Fast forward two years and we were in the UK. My work experience at the Embassy proved invaluable as I found a part-time Communications role after my first interview. I intended that this would allow me some time to reengage in my chosen field of Art Psychotherapy while keeping my options open. This was all going to plan until two events happened, I became pregnant and my partner was requested at their new post in China early. I was excited for all of the great things happening in my personal life but I honestly felt I was, yet again, deflating in my career life. Soon my career ambitions were buried under a pile of diapers, feedings and around the clock care as I was now a full time-mom to a beautiful baby. It was a moment of celebration but as parents will know, when a child comes into your life, a part of your identity is inexorably linked to theirs. The pressure of new motherhood on top of being immersed in a new situation overwhelmed my sense of anything other than the day to day requirements of this amazing, demanding, wonderful new creature I had helped into the world.

I was at a crossroads, I wanted to give my child everything and I wanted to make the most of being in another culture but also knew that realistically I needed an identity of my own to be fulfilled. I then reflected on some freelance web development work I had done for a family member. It was something I had enjoyed but did not pursue beyond hobby status. I was learning Chinese at the time so I thought, why not adjust and try embracing coding? Coding became my "me-time" passion. The more I studied, the more convinced I became that I had found something that would bring the fulfilment I had been seeking in a sustainable way.

Now in our third post in Belgium, I have stopped trying to shoe-horn my aspirations into the limits of my geographical location and focus on balancing a career with being a mom. I've had successes with gaining a data science scholarship, teaching an online course and finishing an ever increasing number of personal projects.  Some days I’m confident I’m making the right choice and others are full of self-doubt. If that sounds familiar, that’s because we have been on this rollercoaster as coders. Deep down, I know I’ve got this. You’ve got this!

### Here is what I feel I have learned so far about carving a new career path and reinventing yourself whilst juggling being a mom:

1. Try for ANY job that peaks your interest. A diverse skill set will actually be an asset. You just have to communicate that effectively.
2. Focus on your core skills and how they translate broadly.
3. Set SMART goals and and action plan.
4. Allow yourself the luxury of time to explore what you are really interested in. Don’t push yourself to figure it all out right away! That, on top of the stresses of life change will actually set you back.
5. Keep your networks active and wide-reaching. The internet is your friend (as long as you can find ways to access it). Look at social media and especially linkedin as good personal branding exercises. Find supportive online communities.
6. If you have a life partner communicate your career support needs clearly and regularly. They ARE your team-mate when you are trying to rearrange your life and your best ally.
