Today was all about breaking down basic command line in a way that any beginner could understand.
The __command line (or terminal)__ is a faster and much more powerful way to maneuver in your operating system than the _graphical user interface (GUI)_ we have all come to rely on so much. It is a less intuitive and uglier way of working with your operating system, but you can do a lot more with it than a GUI! In this post I will cover these basic maneuvers in the command line:
*   navigation
*   creating / removing directories and files
*   moving, copying and pasting things
The end aim is to be ready to utilise the command line to execute Python scripts.

## ‘You've got to find yourself first. Everything else'll follow.’ - Charles De Lint

You may or may not know that your operating system functions as a tree-like system, with everything growing from the __root__ directory. As sub-directories and files are added they grow along an _absolute path_. Each additional level along the tree is added as a "/".
>You may assume that we would therefore start in the __terminal__ at the __root__ as our default. However you would be wrong.

By default, you will begin at the __home__ directory (also known as __~__).
