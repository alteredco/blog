If you are a lifelong learner, like myself, you have had your fair share of educational experiences. I think I have tried it all, from degrees courses to asking a friend to sit and teach me floral arranging over coffee. However, after being saddled by scarily high student loans for my Masters degree, I am very wary of the "traditional" approach to further education.

Enter MOOCs (massive open online courses), which are a great equaliser in opportunities for higher education and tap into a global audience. Many see this as a democratising force in higher education. Certainly as a mom and a traveler, I could not retrain without the flexibility that the virtual learning environment offers.

According to the [MOOC Guide](http://moocguide.wikispaces.com/2.+Benefits+and+challenges+of+a+MOOC):
>12 benefits of a MOOC:
1.    You can organize a MOOC in any setting that has connectivity (which can include the Web, but also local connections via Wi-Fi e.g.)
2.    You can organize it in any language you like (taking into account the main language of your target audience)
3.    You can use any online tools that are relevant to your target region or that are already being used by the participants
4.    You can move beyond time zones and physical boundaries
5.    It can be organized as quickly as you can inform the participants (which makes it a powerful format for priority learning in e.g. aid relief)
6.    Contextualized content can be shared by all
7.    Learning happens in a more informal setting, at a place of your convenience and often around your own schedule.
8.    Learning can also happen incidentally thanks to the unknown knowledge that pops up as the course participants start to exchange notes on the course’s study
9.    You can connect across disciplines and corporate/institutional walls
10.   You don’t need a degree to follow the course, only the willingness to learn (at high speed)
11.   You add to your own personal learning environment and/or network by participating in a MOOC
12.   You will improve your lifelong learning skills, for participating in a MOOC forces you to think about your own learning and knowledge absorption

There are definite challenges in this environment however.
>Possible challenges of a MOOC:
1.    It feels chaotic as participants create their own content
2.    It demands digital literacy
3.    It demands time and effort from the participants
4.    It is organic, which means the course will take on its own trajectory (you have got to let go).
5.    As a participant you need to be able to self-regulate your learning and possibly give yourself a learning goal to achieve.
